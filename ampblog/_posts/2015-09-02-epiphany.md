  <strong>#YouKnowYoureAWebDeveloperWhen</strong> A quick static page accidentally becomes a multipage Bootstrapped site w/ header logo and content in ver 1.1
</div>

## That was my "Ah Ha!" moment

I had been revising what should have been a simple static page with a few lines of text on it for *HOURS*, happily diving down the rabbit hole in order to resolve a few issues I had and adding "just one more thing..." "just one more thing..." until my single simple HTML page had become a sleek multi-page app with a header and a child page and a logo and content all nicely arranged just so in Bootstrap.

By the end of the day I was composing three different methods to describe a dog's tail wagging in Ruby and I was thinking of boiling water in terms of a Ruby method.

Coding is my heroine.

I feel a lot like Remo Williams right about now:

	wags = wags - 1
